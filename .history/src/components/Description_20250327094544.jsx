          Pro or M1 Max chip — the first Apple silicon designed for pros — you
          get groundbreaking performance and amazing battery life. Add to that a
          stunning Liquid Retina XDR display, the best camera and audio ever in
          a Mac notebook, and all the ports you need. The first notebook of its
          kind, this MacBook Pro is a beast. M1 Pro takes the exceptional
          performance of the M1 architecture to a whole new level for pro users.
